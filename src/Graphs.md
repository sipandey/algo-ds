# Graphs

## Objectives

- Explain what a graph is
- Compare and contrast different types of graphs and their use cases in the real world
- Implement a graph using an adjacency list
- Traverse through a graph using BFS and DFS
- Compare and contrast graph traversal algorithms

## What are graphs?

A **graph data structure** consists of a finite (and possibly mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an undirected **graph** or a set of ordered pairs for a directed **graph**

## Uses for Graphs

- Social Networks
- Location / Mapping
- Routing Algorithms
- Visual Hierarchy
- File System Optimizations
- Recommendations ("People also watched", "You might also like...")
- Everywhere!

## Types of Graphs

- Undirected Graph
- Directed Graph
- Weighted Graph
- Unweighted Graph
